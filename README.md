This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Run the development server by either:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

I used twitterapi.io as a more cost-effective solution. The .env.local file is hidden from my repo to protect my twitter API key. Create your own .env.local file in the root directory of this project, and populate it with `TWITTERAPI_IO_KEY=[your API key, no quotes]` to run this project locally.
